# Recruitment practical tasks

- Task_1 
    - Reverse a string,
    - Check if a word is a palindrome,
    - Count each letter in a given text,
    - Find the missing number in an arithmetic sequence that is stored in an array. Numbers stored in an array should be unique. Example1: input array [1,2] number 0 is missing. Example2: [3,0,2,1] number 4 is missing. Example3: [2] array is invalid - two elements are missing 0 and 1.
- Task_2
    - Factorial number with recurency and without,
    - FizzBuzz game,
    - Calculate an angle between hands of a clock
- Task_3
    
    Check if a given number contains digit 3. Rules: Cannot convert number to other type and cannot use built-in functions like Contains, StartsWith etc,
- Task_4

    Create a method that validates date between years: 2001-2099. Rules: Cannot use built-in functions like Calendar etc. Method accepts three parameters: day, month and year. Returns boolean value that states if date is valid or not. Only dates between 2001 and 2099 are going to be validated. 
- Task_5
    Create a program that reads a set of instructions from a file, executes them one by one and prints the result. Example file:
    ```
    add 2
    multiply 3
    apply 10
    ```
    How it works? We take a value from the apply instruction. Its gonna be our start number then we execute the instructions from the top to the bottom.
    ```
    10
    10 + 2
    (10 + 2) * 3
    36 <-- final result
    ```
